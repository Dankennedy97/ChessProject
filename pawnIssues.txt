pawn misreading location of black pieces in front of it - this can help with king piece
Pawn can take a piece on the other side of the board - found the location in the pawn code,
^*UPDATE* pawn cant take piece from starting position but can still take piece from other side of the board
White has as many turns as it wants - fix this last
